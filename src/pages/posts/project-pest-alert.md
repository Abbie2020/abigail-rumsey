<h3>The solution</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Pest Risk Information Service (PRISE) project, funded by the UK Space Agency, aims to use satellite data and biological models of pests to predict when pests are going to become a problem and when the right time to take action is</li>
				<li>I have been working with colleagues in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia along with pest development and data experts in the UK consortium to convert their scientific predictions into actionable, understandable messages for farmers and agricultural extension officers</li>
