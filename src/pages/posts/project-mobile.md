excerpt: >-
  More and more users of the Plantwise Knowledge Bank were visiting on a
  smartphone so we redesigned the site to be mobile-first.

<h3>The solution</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I created a <mark>mobile-first design</mark> for the website that centred around searching for a pest or crop. While users wanted to filter their results by country, they didn’t want to start their journey at a country homepage as previously thought.</li>
				<li>As the main page that users visited was the pest species page, which has a lot of information on it, I created distinct sections with large images so that users could check that they were looking at the right pest</li>
				<li>I added in <mark>HTML, responsive, versions of content</mark> that had previously only been in PDF so that users could easily view this on a mobile device</li>
				<li>I also added ‘share’ options as agricultural extension officers like to share the pest management information that they’ve found with farmers they are helping</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How I approached the project</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>I led the <mark>user research</mark> exercise, using our existing personas and an on-site questionnaire. I used Google Analytics and FullStory to find out what information users are looking for and the pathways that they take to get to that information.
</li>
			<blockquote>It was clear that most users were coming to the PWKB to find information about a specific pest. They usually knew the name of the pest and many were looking for information specific to their country.</blockquote>
            <li>As the user journey was different to what was thought when the site was originally designed, <mark>I pushed to completely redesign the site rather than just convert the existing site to be responsive.</mark></li>
			<li>I ran a <mark>sketch workshop</mark> (Crazy 8s) with the PWKB team to get everyone’s ideas for mobile designs of each part of the site</li>
			<li>I created <mark>interactive wireframes in Axure</mark> based on our sketches</li>
			<li>I <mark>tested the wireframes with plant doctors in Kenya</mark>. They were able to complete tasks such as searching for pest information. They also gave me a great insight into how they would use the website as part of their job.
