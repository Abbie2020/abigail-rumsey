      I have built up my <mark>UX skills</mark> over
      the past eight years working on a variety of projects in both
      international development and scientific publishing. I find there is
      nothing more useful to my job than spending time talking to <mark>real
      life users</mark>. I keep up-to-date by attending local UX and product
      meetups, plus reading the internet (almost finished!). My passion is
      <mark>nerding out with technology</mark>. I’m into
      <mark>prototyping</mark> using whatever tools are necessary. I am
      currently teaching myself front end web development, including <mark>HTML,
      CSS and Javascript</mark>, and aim to learn React next. I'm looking for a new challenge in a new part of the world.
