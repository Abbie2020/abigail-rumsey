      Hi, I’m <mark>Abbie</mark>. I’m a <mark>user experience designer</mark>
      looking for a new challenge in a new part of the world. I have built up my
      <mark>UX skills</mark> over the past eight years working on a variety of
      projects in both international development and scientific publishing. I
      find there is nothing more useful to my job than spending time talking to
      <mark>real life users</mark>. I keep up-to-date by attending local UX and
      product meetups, plus reading the internet (almost finished!). My passion
      is <mark>nerding out with technology</mark>. I’m into
      <mark>prototyping</mark> using whatever tools are necessary. I am
      currently teaching myself front end web development, including <mark>HTML,
      CSS and Javascript</mark>, and aim to learn React next.
